Oral Health and Nutrition
================

# About this space

The focus is to highlight the relationship between nutrition and oral heath.

A key component of our research at Dublin Dental University Hospital, Trintiy College Dublin, University of Dublin, has been to describe eating patterns of cariogenic food and drink especially sugar intake using data from national nutritional surveys. 
In Ireland and the UK it is estimated that 30-40% of 2-5 year olds have largely untreated dental decay, which leads to pain, infection and time away from school/preschool. Dental infection is the leading cause of emergency hospital admissions in children. Dental disease is largely preventable, so understanding the prevalence and distribution of risk factors can form the basis of targeted prevention programmes. A detailed, longitudinal analysis of the consumption pattern of “high-sugar” food and drinks in an Irish population cohort has not been described.
