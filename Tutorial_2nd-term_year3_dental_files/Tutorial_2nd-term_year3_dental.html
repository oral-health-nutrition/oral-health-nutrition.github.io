# How to use nutritics effectively

- use regularly 
- you have a user profile and 'activity' on Nutritics
- use learning material https://www.nutritics.com/p/userguide&amp;c=471_VIDEO
- incorporate into your regular assessment



???
In gen this class vg ood users
if u dotn use it at all then why are u here?

stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt (B Russel)

NB useful for your exams to have half dozen facts at the tip of your tongue.
eg reccomended 10% FS max per day pop guidleine by WHO (ideally 5%)
400g of fruit n veg day  OR fibre/d = 24-34g/d

We know that approx 
60% eat HFSS snacks every day  (Healthy Ireland, 2015)
  + 42% of these eat 6 or more portions daily. 
- 14% consume sugar sweetened drinks daily, 
  + rising to 22% of those aged 15 to 2
  

-  Less than 10% of daily energy from saturated fats
-  Less than 1% of daily energy from trans fats
-  Less than 10% of daily energy from added sugars progressively reducing to 5%*
-  More than 400g fruits and vegetables a day
-  Less than 5g a day of salt (6 g population recommendation FSAI 2016)

# Dietary Reference Values (DRVs)
 
 ![](assets/img/RDA_Vits_Mins.png)

???
SO then we introduce the basis for nutrient based guideliens and DRVs etc so that they understand how to interpet the nutrient report followiing a dietary assessment.
Obviosuly, We highlight then utrients of particular relevance for oral health and explain their key functions and problems associated with deficiencies.


END
As you know its important to remember are that these HEG and DRVs are for a healthy population! AND they are age/growth dependant
DRV’s are also known as NRV’s (Nutrient Reference Values –
. If an individual is routinely consuming the RNI for a particular nutrient, it can be assumed that their diet provides adequate amounts (or more than adequate amounts) of that nutrient.

2. If an individual is consuming less than the RNI, it cannot necessarily be assumed that the diet is inadequate, as the person may have a lower requirement than average for that particular nutrient.
There are No DRVs for sick people!
An Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): The average amount of nutrient or energy required. Approximately 50% of the population will require more and 50% will require less.

A Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI): The amount of a nutrient sufficient to meet the needs of 97.5% of a population (calculated from the EAR + 2 SD)

# CRA and Dietary Assessment (FSN3.4 Nutrition)

- Dietary assessment, e.g., 24HR (multiple)
- Estimate total/free sugar intake
- Food groups/HEG's
- Meal patterns-snacking
- Dietary behaviours assessment* 

???
confusion- u mneed to understand and intrepet and integrate info. No  one simple solution, this is reality of patients
CRA ADA includes
Categorise a patient after
Diet assessment - all patients but how often
Use your knowledge, logic, supporting evidence, history

See behaviours list queries also

# Dietary assessment

- use digital tools
- patient compliance
- digital literacy
- education-behaviour change

create a diet log

Once you have sewt up a patient on the system u enter their details, weight, height, PAL, any other spcefici energy requirements or adjustments and then creat a diet log. This cvan be in any format or tool you decide from 24HR to 5day food diary

NB Absoprtion factors, digest etc, V actual intake
The 2nd apsect is that the nutrient content of foods consumed need to be convereted using a food composition database.

# Nutrient profile

![:scale 80%](assets/img/NR1.png)
???
once you have completed the diet log you then can generate a nutrient report and this is the initial part of a sample one.
On the top row you can see the source for DRVs is the EU;EFSA database, the estimated energy requirement is a calculate value and then the period of assessment and age, height and weight of the patienbt. 
YOu can see the energy intake and macrontrient profile here. The columns indicate the limits, actual intake and targets
---
![:scale 90%](assets/img/NR2.png)

???
And then you csan see the carbohydrates, fibre, sugars intake and so on
SO inclusion of free sugar content ( which we are obviosuly intetrested in) is still not compulsory in the EU but is in the USA. So that is something they are compiling at the moment

---
![:scale 90%](assets/img/NR3.png)
???

This iindicates the minerals/Trace elements so we can see at a glance that this patinet is consuming less than the ref nutr intake (RNI) for Iron, Zn and selenium.
SO thats useful but of course only a guide as its based on aveg population values, so only if an individual is consistently consuming less than the LRNI for a nutrient, can it be assumed that the person is deficient in that particular nutrient.

---
![:scale 90%](assets/img/NR4.png)
???
And finally, we can see the vitamin profile and compare to the RNI
You can also click the tab on the RHS and add in recommended food sources for specific nutrients and teh actual food sources in the that indiviudal patients diet 

---
# Interpret RNI's-DRV's

- If Less than RNI -&gt; can't assume inadequate
- If Less than LRNI -&gt; assume person deficient 
- DRVs apply to healthy people only!

https://www.nutritics.com/en/support/dietary-reference-values-drvs

![:scale 45%](assets/img/Fig_DRV.png)
???
Indivi ROUTINE consuming RNI for a nutrient then assume diet provides adequate amounts of that nutrient!
&lt; RNI- person might have lower than avge requirement for that nutrient!
If Less than LRNI (meets needs of 2.5%) -&gt; assume person deficient 
NB healthy only -not sick or eg elite athlete

# Dietary behaviours assessment*

.small[1. Are you following a special diet?
2. Do you take any form of vitamin, herbal or dietary supplement?
2. What changes have you made to your diet in the last 6-12months?
3. What food restrictions or allergies do you have?
4. Do you avoid any food or drink because of condition of your mouth?
5. Have you had any unintentional weight loss in last 6 months?
6. How often and when do you brush your teeth?]

* Combine: 
  * Dietary behaviours assessment
  * Dietary assessment- nutrient report (nutritics)
  

???
These are the type of quesitons you sohuld be consdering when assessing the dietary behaviours of a patient

NB this assumes you have already added to this data- wgt, hgt, BMI, med Hx, medication, prosthesis etc as part of your overall risk assessment
Quantify any unintentional weight loss, &gt;10% wegiht loss? Calc BMI class- underwegt, normal etc.

Assess maasticatory ability, occluding pairs etc, saliva, taste/sensory impairments, 

Add to Nutritics/CRA form

# Do's and Don'ts

- Do diet (and caries risk) assessment for all patients

- DO NOT use a paper based diary!

- How often? (depends on risk profile)

- Iterative process (do, repeat, modify, re-do)

- Remember caries is a life-long cumulative disease

???

confidentiality: DO NOT transfer the name of the patient AND only use the
patient's hospital number as identifier in the Nutritics documents
5. You must provide the patient with dietary analysis, estimation and education/intervention

- The Dunning-Kruger effect (DK effect) (cognitive bias) is a psychological phenomenon which implies that individuals with lack of knowledge and skills have an unrealistically optimistic image of their abilities compared to others. 
- stupid are cocksure and the confident are full of doubt
- so why start with this?
- exam performance, failure to see the benefit to patinets of developing your assessment, counselling and preventive skills, "we've done it all before in pbl"!
- the mechanics of how you do a dietary assessment should not be difficult if you apply yourself. The hardest part is developing the communication skills to be able to change the patieints dietary behaviours!

## Tutorial on dietary assessment - Nutritics
 
- ALL new patient assessments MUST have a dietary assessment done using Nutritics        
- DO NOT use paper based sheets and then 'transfer' into Nutritics. 
- Beginning treatment without a full risk assessment (including diet) is not good practice 
- OSCE’s in 3rd and 4th year will be based on Nutritics and/or dietary assessment
???
3 people NOT registered or activated licences, I have to monitor and maintian all licences. 
You have all been taught how to use Nutritics and been advised that you are to use it with the patient in the dental chair so they can see the foods/portion sized etc and provide you with an opportunity to learn how to develop your patient communication skills also. 
3rd or 4th year (2022) as follows so that we can follow the users for the year as you progress

# Methods and tools for dietary intake assessment

![](assets/img/Diet_assessment_system.PNG)


???


-Nutritional assessment is the first step in addressing diet with patients.
This flow chart gives the students a framework to understand the diff assem tools that can be used depdning on the desired focus and how that then translates into nutrient reports and interpetation of results.

-Subsequent stages include planning and implementing interventions, and evaluating their effectiveness.

-Most dietary assessment tools include questions about behaviors associated with food intake. And this is obviuosly essentiual for oral health

-The clinical assessment typically begins with a well- structured history to identify conditions likely to be associated with nutritional deficiencies, and a dietary history to indicate unusual dietary patterns or major changes in dietary intake.

---
# OSCE 3rd years
- Thursday 25th April
- Nutritics based scenario
- Read Personal details and Nutrient report
- Answers are brief, no essays required!
- Macronutrient analysis in report also
- Note 'ranges' and 'targets' for RNI's

???
Know your free sugar guidelines and what they mean in terms of amount
BMI calssification WHO obese range
macronutrients cho, fat protein- kcals, can state re eg fat and which fat largest etc but main category 1st eg FAT
RNI or recomended range (target), differs wrt nutrtient, eg range CHO
If asked approximate estimation then its treble, double, etc NO calculator required, not 1 and 1/4 etc. !!!!
