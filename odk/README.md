# ODK 

Open Data Toolkit [ODK](https://getodk.org/) is a powerful offline forms to collect the data you need wherever it is.

We used it in conjuction with [Kobo Toolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) to collect data about the health metrics.

We developed our templates based on the [WHO - OralHealth Surveys - Basic Methods](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/97035/9789241548649_eng.pdf;jsessionid=9D80F63471B9C335CF359381553DF0F2?sequence=)

We mapped common templates for data collection such as  ![INTERNATIONAL CARIES DETECTION AND ASSESSMENT SYSTEM II (ICDAS II)](Selection_014.png) 
 ![ to a digital version](Selection_015.png)

You can reuse the full template for your projects or just some of the questions you might need in your survey.
